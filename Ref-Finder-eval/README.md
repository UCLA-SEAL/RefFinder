# Ref-Finder-eval
Evaluation dataset for Ref-Finder 

RefFinder  identifies complex refactorings between two program versions using a template-based refactoring reconstruction approach---RefFinder expresses each refactoring type in terms of template logic rules and uses a logic programming engine to infer concrete refactoring instances. It currently supports sixty three refactoring types from Fowler's catalog, showing the most comprehensive coverage among existing techniques.
